                <h4>Generative AI</h4>
                <p>
                  Welcome to the frontier of technology. As the first club in Egypt to offer a dedicated Generative AI track, we’re giving you a front-row seat to the most important science of our time. You’ll understand how large and well-known models like ChatGPT and Claude actually work. Learn to build your own models to generate text and images, create customized AI tools tailored to your needs, and develop AI agents capable of automating your entire workflow.

                <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
                <p>
                  Machine Learning is about building programs that learn from data to predict values, make decisions, and recognize patterns.
In this track, members learn how to train models to predict outcomes (like prices or scores), make intelligent choices (such as classifying spam vs. non-spam), and differentiate between images by learning what makes a cat different from a car.
We also dive into Deep Learning, where neural networks learn complex patterns from large data—powering technologies like face recognition, medical imaging, and self-driving cars.

                <h4>Quantum Computing</h4>
                <p>
                  A field that needs no introduction. We’ve all wondered how Quantum Computers actually function and why they represent the next great leap in human history. In this track, we move past the hype and dive into the mechanics. You’ll explore the fascinating principles of quantum mechanics that power these machines and learn how they are set to solve problems that are impossible for today’s supercomputers. Step into the world of the "impossible."

                <h4>Competitive Programming</h4>
                <p>
                  Dive into the realm of elite problem-solving. In the competitive programming track, you won’t just write code; you’ll master the algorithms and data structures that define the world’s top engineers. From optimizing execution time to architecting elegant solutions for complex mathematical challenges, you’ll gain the tools to break down any problem into its most efficient form. In this arena, every millisecond counts and every logic leap matters. If you can think it, you can solve it.

                <h4>Cybersecurity</h4>
                <p>
                  Cybersecurity is about protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, misuse, and unauthorized access.
                  In this track, members learn how attackers think, how vulnerabilities appear, and how to defend against threats like malware, phishing, and network intrusions. They explore topics such as securing servers, analyzing suspicious activity, and protecting user data from leaks or breaches.
                  We also dive into ethical hacking, where students learn how to test systems safely by finding weaknesses before attackers do—helping secure websites, applications, and infrastructure used in the real world.

                <p>
                  Step into the world of professional game development. In the game development track, you won’t just build simple mechanics; you’ll master the Godot Engine to bring entire universes to life. From sculpting fluid animations and crafting nostalgic pixel art to architecting complex game logic, you’ll gain the tools to build any interactive experience from the first sprite to the final build. Whether it’s a high-octane platformer or an immersive RPG, if you can dream the world, you can code the game.

                        Orpheus and Codey have built a curious little machine. The machine looks at a list of new members and tries to decide which club fits each member bestThe machine sees things like activities, and past experiences Sometimes it assigns members to the right club
                        Other times, it is far off from the right one. For example, a person who is passionate about geology is assigned to the math club instead of the geology club Orpheus is unsure what the machine is missing Codey turns to you for help. <b>How would you approach this problem and solve the issue ?</b>
                        What would you like to know about the machine before doing anything ?
                        How would you make the machine work properly ?

                        Orpheus and Codey are standing in the Valley of Numbers. Each stone in the valley has a number written on it — some are negative, some are positive. <br>
                        Orpheus turns to Codey and says: <br>
                        “Among all these stones, we must choose two whose combined value is closest to zero.” Codey nods and asks you for help. <br>
